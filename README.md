## Notes and gists

Short public notes. These are **not** product reviews.

**Official** = written by TDK maintainers or website contributors.

**Community** = independent authors.
Prefer [tdk-cli-core docs](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core/tree/main/docs) when the gist and the docs disagree.

## Tools and technologies

TDK works across a broad local-development stack. This index separates core requirements from generated app technology, optional infrastructure, official example integrations, and contributor tooling. Optional means a feature can be enabled when needed; paid items require a TDK license. Each group links to TDK's feature reference, source manifest, or example for context.

**Stack at a glance:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) for the CLI | [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs) for service workflows | [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs) as an opt-in database workflow | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) | [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) | [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/) | [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) | [Vite](https://vite.dev/) | [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) | [Hono](https://hono.dev/) | [NATS](https://docs.nats.io/).
